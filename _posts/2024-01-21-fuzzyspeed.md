For my Fuzzy Logic undergrad class we were required to do a project. This was a fairly open ended design project which included both a MATLAB simulation section as well as a hardware implentation section, and was a collaborative effort between me and my classmate **Cooper Burns** (insert LinkedIn link here). I mainly dealt with the hardware section, which I will describe in this article. 

## The Plan ##

The plan for this project was to design a fuzzy logic controller such that, while approaching an object (a wall, box, or any object detectable by an ultrasonic sensor), a robotâ€™s speed would decrease based on the distance from that object, getting slower and slower as it gets closer until it stops a set distance away.

## Hardware Setup ##

The hardware for this project was based on [this](https://osoyoo.com/2020/03/01/use-raspberry-pi-to-control-mecanum-omni-wheel-robot-car/) osoyoo robot kit, but generally to do this project one would need:

| Hardware        |      We Used      |
| ----------------- | :--------------: |
| Single Board Computer     | RaspberryPi 4 |
| Motor Controller      |   Osoyoo L298n based module    |
| Geared DC Motor |   osoyoo Motors     |
| Ultrasonic Sensor |   HC-SR04    |
| Robot Chassis |   Osoyoo chassis    |

The robot was setup according to the instructions [here](https://osoyoo.com/2020/03/01/use-raspberry-pi-to-control-mecanum-omni-wheel-robot-car/), but fundamentally the hardware translates to the following control diagram:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/Fuzzy-Logic speed controller/ControlFlowDiagram.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

## Software Setup and code walk through ##

After the hardware was setup, the software was created to implement the control scheme using python -- a setup guide for which is provided on the [github](https://github.com/EOC-dev/FuzzyLogicSpeedControllerV1) page for this project.

Below is the state flow diagram for the main python program:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/Fuzzy-Logic speed controller/FuzzyMechanumStateFlow.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Finally, here is a video of the code working in action:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/Fuzzy-Logic speed controller/FuzzyLogic_FinalProject_Test2-(720p30).mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Pretty cool, huh?
</div>

## What could be improved? ##

1. An astute observer will note a disturbing lack of hardware interrupts in the source code. This was mainly because I was still going through my Embedded Systems class and was not comfortable using hardware interrupts extensively yet. Micropython supports interrupts [natively](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/isr_rules.html), and Circuitpython supports them [indirectly](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython-with-asyncio) using the asyncio module. Both Micropython and Circuitpython are supported on the raspberry pi (see [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) and [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/overview)). If I were to return to this project I would absolutely use interrupts.
2. One may also notice from the video the crude breadboard voltage divider, this was made out of necessity as there was a mismatch between the output signal from the Ultrasonic sensor and the maximum input voltage of the Rpi's GPIO pins. While our solution worked, A more elegant solution would be to use a logic level shifter.
3. Since doing this project I have since learned about the [Embedded Fuzzy Logic Library](https://github.com/alvesoaj/eFLL), which allows emplementing fuzzy logic controllers on microcontrollers. I think it would be neat to design a fuzzy controller using the skfuzzy library, then implement it on hardware using the eFLL.
